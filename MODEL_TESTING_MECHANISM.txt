# Model Testing Mechanism - Scientific Analysis System

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive model testing system that provides scientific analysis and comparison between Lyra (Groq Llama-3.3) and Solace (Groq Llama-4) models using professional-grade metrics and visualizations.

## Model Configuration

### Model Comparison Details
- **Lyra**: Uses Groq API with `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` model
- **Solace**: Uses Groq API with `meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct` model
- **Both**: Cloud-based Groq API models with different underlying architectures
- **Backend Logic**: Both models are accessed through the same Groq API but with different model specifications

### Technical Implementation
- **Lyra Model**: `model_preference: "groq"` → Backend uses `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`
- **Solace Model**: `model_preference: "local"` → Backend maps to `meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct`
- **API Endpoint**: Both use the same `/chat` endpoint with different model configurations

## Scoring Algorithm

### Comprehensive Score Calculation
The system uses a weighted scoring algorithm that combines multiple metrics:

```
Final Score = (Confidence Score × 0.4) + (Time Score × 0.3) + (Source Relevance Score × 0.3)
```

### Individual Metric Calculations

#### 1. Confidence Score (40% weight)
- **Range**: 0-100 points
- **Calculation**: `confidence * 100`
- **Purpose**: Measures model's confidence in its responses

#### 2. Time Score (30% weight)
- **Range**: 0-100 points
- **Optimal Range**: 0.5-3 seconds
- **Calculation**:
  - < 0.5s: `60 + (time * 80)` (penalty for too fast)
  - 0.5-3s: `100 - ((time - 0.5) * 10)` (optimal range)
  - 3-10s: `75 - ((time - 3) * 5)` (acceptable range)
  - > 10s: `max(20, 25 - ((time - 10) * 2))` (slow penalty)

#### 3. Source Relevance Score (30% weight)
- **Range**: 0-100 points
- **Calculation**: `sourceRelevance * 100`
- **Purpose**: Measures the quality and relevance of sources provided
- **Scoring Logic**:
  - Base relevance: 50% (default)
  - Additional relevance per source: +10% (up to 100%)
  - Quality bonus for sources with title and URL: +20%
  - Quality bonus for sources with detailed snippets: +10%
  - Maximum relevance: 100%

## Performance Analysis

### Winner Determination
The system determines the overall winner using a composite score:

```
Composite Score = (avgConfidence × 0.4) + (speedScore × 0.3) + (avgTotalScore/100 × 0.3)
```

Where:
- `speedScore = max(0, 1 - avgTime/10)` (inverted time score)
- Winner is determined by comparing composite scores
- Margin is calculated as percentage difference

### Scientific Conclusion
The system provides a scientific conclusion based on:
1. **Statistical Analysis**: Average performance across all metrics
2. **Reliability Assessment**: Success rate and consistency
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Direct model-to-model comparison
