# 🔧 Profile System Setup Instructions

Your profile page was using fake data before. Here's how to set up **real profile saving** to Supabase:

## 📋 Step 1: Set Up Profiles Table

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** → **SQL Editor**
2. **Copy and paste** the entire contents of `supabase_profiles_setup.sql`
3. **Click "Run"** to create the profiles table with security policies

## 📋 Step 2: Migrate Existing Users

1. **Still in SQL Editor**, copy and paste the contents of `migration_create_missing_profiles.sql`
2. **Click "Run"** to create profile records for all existing users
3. **Check the results** - you should see how many profiles were created

## 📋 Step 3: Test It

1. **Start your app**: `npm run dev`
2. **Sign in** with an existing account
3. **Go to Profile page** - it should now load your data
4. **Edit name/bio** and click "Save Changes"
5. **Refresh the page** - your changes should persist!

## 🔍 Step 4: Verify in Database

- Go to **Supabase Dashboard** → **Table Editor** → **profiles**
- You should see all your users with their profile data

## ⚠️ What If It Still Doesn't Work?

The profile page now has **better error handling**:

- ❌ If profiles table doesn't exist → Shows setup instructions
- ❌ If profile creation fails → Shows detailed error message
- ✅ Falls back to user metadata if database isn't ready
- ✅ Automatically creates profiles for users who don't have them

## 🎯 What Changed

**Before:**
- ❌ Fake `setTimeout` simulation
- ❌ No database interaction  
- ❌ Data lost on refresh

**After:**
- ✅ Real Supabase database saves
- ✅ Automatic profile creation for existing users
- ✅ Data persists between sessions
- ✅ Proper error handling & fallbacks
- ✅ Row Level Security enabled

Once you run the SQL scripts, your profile system will be fully functional! 🚀
